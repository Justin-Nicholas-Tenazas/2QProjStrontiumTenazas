        <h2>Facts!</h2>
        <h3>Did you know:</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>> From the start of their career, ITZY has kept a very consistent girl crush concept, as well as the concept of keeping true to yourself and not being defined by anyone.</li>
        <li>> All the members, except for Lia, had competed to be in a JYP group through various survival shows like Mix9ine, Stray Kids, and Sixteen.</li>
        <li>> ITZY's dorm arrangement has been consistent, with Lia and Yuna in one room, Ryujin and Yeji in another, and Chaeryeong by herself in a third room. This only changed in 2021, when Yeji became Chaeryeong's roommate.</li>
        <li>> The group's debut track, Dalla Dalla, came out on February 12, 2019, and it immediately resonated with fans.</li>
        <li>> ITZY may only have been active for two years, but they already have a large following of fans!</li>
        <li>> Yeji, Chaeryeong, and Ryujin, sometimes collectively known as "the dance line," have been chosen as Studio Choom's Artist of the Month, for March, August, and November 2021 respectively.</li>
        <li>> At the start of their career, ITZY took around 3 days to memorize new choreographies. Now, it only takes them one day!</li>
        <li>> ITZY releases English versions of their title tracks, such as Dalla Dalla and Not Shy.</li>
        <li>> ITZY are only one of six artists to achieve the Rookie Grand Slam, which is achieved by getting the "Rookie of the Year" award in all five major South Korean music award shows (MMA, MAMA, SMA, Gaon Chart, and GDA, source <a href="https://www.koreaboo.com/news/aespa-kpop-artists-achieve-rookie-grand-slam/">https://www.koreaboo.com/news/aespa-kpop-artists-achieve-rookie-grand-slam/</a>)</li>
        <li>> ITZY's latest comeback, Weapon, was a song specifically made for the show "Street Dance Girls Fighter," which is a spin-off of the iconic Street Woman Fighter.</li>
        <li>> None of the ITZY members are only children! Each of them have siblings, such as Yeji's older sister Yeju, Lia's younger brother Junsu, and Chaeryeong's sisters Chaeyeon (older, formerly of IZ*ONE) and Chaemin (younger).</li>
        <li>> ITZY made and released a song specifically for MIDZY: Trust Me (MIDZY). It's a calm song where the members express their love and gratitude to their ever-steadfast and dedicated fans.</li>
        <li>> Netizens agree that all the members of ITZY are visuals in their own right and not just Yuna, who is the official visual of the group.</li>
        <li>> ITZY maintains a good relationship with their labelmates like Stray Kids and their senior TWICE.</li>
