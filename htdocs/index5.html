        <h2>Facts!</h2>
        <h3>Did you know:</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>> In her time, IU was one of the younger artists to make her debut.</li>
	<li>> While she's known for her amazing and super-emotional vocals, she can dance and rap as well as other idols!</li>
	<li>> Many idols have named Ji-eun as their ideal type, like BTS's Jung Kook and TXT's Beomgyu.</li>
	<li>> Her latest comeback, strawberry moon, was released in 2021, marking her 13th year active in the music industry!</li>
	<li>> IU's acting history is fairly long, with her starring in K-dramas like Dream High (as the shy Kim Pil-sook) and Hotel Del Luna (as the bossy Jang Man-wol).</li>
	<li>> IU's collaborated with many other idols on a lot of tracks, such as BIGBANG's G-Dragon on the song "Palette", 2AM's Seulong on the song "Nagging", and BTS's SUGA on the song "Eight".</li>
	<li>> IU's story is actually really sad. When she was young, her parents fell into debt and she had to live with her grandmother, cousin, and brother, where "it was always cold and we never had enough to eat" (source <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKBYlJODJ24">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKBYlJODJ24</a>).</li>
	<li>> It didn't end there; IU's lost some of her closest friends too, like Goo Hara and SHINee's Jonghyun.</li>
	<li>> Ji-eun has been very expressive about her love of chocolates throughout her life.</li>
	<li>> She has her own show: IU's Palette, named after her hit song which was about growing up and discovering your tastes.</li>
	<li>> IU's gained so much popularity in South Korea that she has a unique title: Nation's Little Sister!.</li>
        </ul>
